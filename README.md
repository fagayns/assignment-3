  -Sample Usage
In the main method of the PersonalAccount class, we demonstrated how to:
1.Create an account.
2.Perform deposit and withdrawal transactions.
3.Check the balance and print the transaction history.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to document the PersonalAccount class using Javadoc-style comments:
  /**
 * This class represents a personal bank account and provides methods
 * to deposit, withdraw, and check account balance, as well as view transaction history.
 */
public class PersonalAccount {
    // Instance variables and methods
}
-Testing
You can test the following scenarios:
1.Depositing valid and invalid amounts.
2.Withdrawing valid and invalid amounts (including trying to withdraw more than the balance).
3.Checking the balance after each transaction.
